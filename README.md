# Neighborhood-Maps-Project
This web app is a project for the Udacity [FSND Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004).

## Project Overview
Developed a single page application featuring a map of New York museums I would like to visit. Also added functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content. All application components are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers. 

## Functionalities 
- A list-view of location names is provided which displays all locations by default, and displays the filtered subset of locations when a  filter is applied.
- Map displays all location markers by default, and displays the filtered subset of location markers when a filter is applied.
- The filter includes a text input field that filters the map markers and list items to locations matching the text input.
- Clicking a location on the list (or) on a marker displays unique information about the location, and animates its associated map marker.
- Clicking the hamburger icon toggles (shows/hides) the left side bar.
- All application components render on-screen in a responsive manner.
